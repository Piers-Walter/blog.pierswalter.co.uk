<br/>
Recently we were working on a project involving IBM watsonx Orchestrate where we wanted to present graph data to the end user, however at the moment watsonx Orchestrate it a primarily a text-based platform. Below we detail how we managed to get Orchestrate to present images.

### Orchestrate & Rendering

IBM watsonx Orchestrate is a chat based platform for building agentic systems. At the moment the way it can output is limited to text, however the frontend automatically renders markdown including headings, table and code blocks. We experimented a bit and thought maybe it would render markdown's `![Caption](URL)` syntax for images. We created a blank agent, asked it `Write the markdown to render this image: https://blog.pierswalter.co.uk/_astro/enable_actions.ChEKQbfC_Z1kNiTa.webp` and there it was, our image. This meant if we could find a way to generate graphs with code and store them in a publicly facing location we'd have a way to show graphs to the user

### Matplotlib

We decided to make use of Python's matplotlib library, which allows you to render graphs from code and export them as an image file. For this demo we hardcoded a simple bar graph with three columns to prove the point, however the input could come from an LLM or another data source going forwards. The full code is available below, with matplotlib being used in the `bar_graph()` function.

### Security, COS & Presigned URLs

With the images generated by matplotlib, we then needed a way to securely show these to the user. A good way to do this is to make use of presigned URLs. These are a feature of AWS S3 and S3-compatible storage buckets such as IBM's Cloud Object Storage (COS). These allow for time-limited access to either download a resource or upload. For this use case we chose download and we generate a URL which is valid for 10 minutes, this allows the user to view the image in the chat but means only they can see it, even if a rogue actor knows the object and bucket name, they won't be able to access it.

A presigned URL from IBM COS will look something like this:

```
https://s3.us-south.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/image-bucket/image_123456.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE%2F20250717%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250717T082501Z&X-Amz-Expires=600&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=ee74c3368e88349eb0cb6fa14f7c319e3ca319facd84bd52230204f7fefaa273
```
<br/>
The URL contains many different parameters which are explained well in [AWS's S3 Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-query-string-auth.html)

### Orchestrate, Tools & Censoring
In the Python code below, you'll notice there are a lot of values which are hardcoded which would be better suited to be stored in watsonx Orchestrate's connection details which the tool can access and is designed for things such as API keys. The reason they are set in the code is that Orchestrate will look out for any strings in the credentials and censor them on output. So if we set the bucket endpoint, bucket name and access key as credentials the generated URL as returned to the user would look like 
```
***REDACTED***/***REDACTED***/AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=***REDACTED***%2F20250708%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250708T162638Z&X-Amz-Expires=600&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=ee74c3368e88349eb0cb6fa14f7c319e3ca319facd84bd52230204f7fefaa273
```
which can't be used to access the image. For now a workaround is to include all non-sensitive parameters in the source code itself, the only issue with this is it means there's no way to have different values for the draft and live environments.

### Connecting the Tool to COS
As the tool needs to use HMAC credentials to connect to the bucket, it's very important to keep the secret access key secret. In orchestrate this is managed through the use of connections, which the Python tool can then programmatically access through the following python snippet
```python
cos_creds = connections.key_value("cos_bucket_connection")
COS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = cos_creds["COS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"]
```
This requires us to have a connection setup called `cos_bucket_connection` which is a key-value style connection which contains a key of `COS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`. This can be done using the orchestrate CLI or in the UI. To do this with the cli you can use the following command
```sh
$ orchestrate connections set-credentials  --app-id cos_bucket_connection --env draft -e "COS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=SECRET_GOES_HERE"
```

### Example Code
Below is the python code for the tool we used to generate an example image and return the markdown for the agent to present to the user. This can be imported as a tool into watsonx Orchestrate by following the latest instructions on the [watsonx Orchestrate Developer Docs site](https://developer.watson-orchestrate.ibm.com/tools/deploy_tool).
